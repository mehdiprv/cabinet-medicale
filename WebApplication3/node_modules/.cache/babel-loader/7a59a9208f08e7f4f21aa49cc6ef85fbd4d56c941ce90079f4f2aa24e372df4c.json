If we do so, we will return to you a fair proportion of any sum you have paid us in advance for the supply of that service, taking into account the service we have already supplied to you.</p>\r\n    </Fragment>\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default TermsOfUse;"],"mappings":";AAAA,SAASA,QAAQ,QAAQ,OAAO;AAChC,SAASC,OAAO,EAAEC,IAAI,QAAQ,kBAAkB;AAChD,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,yBAAyB;AAC7C,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,aAAa;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAG/B,MAAMC,UAAU,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EACrB,oBAAOD,OAAA,CAACN,QAAQ;IAAAQ,QAAA,gBACZF,OAAA;MAAQG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACO,MAAO;MAAAF,QAAA,gBAC9BF,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACQ,IAAK;QAAAH,QAAA,eACzBF,OAAA,CAACJ,IAAI;UAACU,EAAE,EAAC,OAAO;UAAAJ,QAAA,eACZF,OAAA;YAAKO,GAAG,EAAET,KAAM;YAACU,GAAG,EAAC;UAAO;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAE;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAC7B;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACN,CAAC,eACNZ,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACgB,GAAI;QAAAX,QAAA,eACxBF,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,gBACIF,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,GAAI,GAAC,eAAAF,OAAA,CAACL,OAAO;cAACW,EAAE,EAAC,YAAY;cAACH,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACiB,IAAK;cAAAZ,QAAA,EAAC;YAAQ;cAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAS,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC9EZ,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,GAAI,GAAC,eAAAF,OAAA,CAACL,OAAO;cAACW,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;cAACH,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACiB,IAAK;cAAAZ,QAAA,EAAC;YAAM;cAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAS,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACzE;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACJ,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACF,CAAC,eACTZ,OAAA;MAASG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACkB,SAAU;MAAAb,QAAA,eAClCF,OAAA;QAAIG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACmB,KAAM;QAAAd,QAAA,EAAC;MAAsB;QAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACpD,CAAC,eACVZ,OAAA;MAAGG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACoB,SAAU;MAAAf,QAAA,EAAC;IAAujB;MAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC5lBZ,OAAA;MAAIG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACqB,MAAO;MAAAhB,QAAA,EAAC;IAAU;MAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC9CZ,OAAA;MAAGG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACsB,IAAK;MAAAjB,QAAA,EAAC;IAAypB;MAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACzrBZ,OAAA;MAAIG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACqB,MAAO;MAAAhB,QAAA,EAAC;IAAc;MAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAClDZ,OAAA;MAAGG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACsB,IAAK;MAAAjB,QAAA,GAAC,+DAA6D,eAAAF,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,eAAAZ,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,iFACjG,eAAAZ,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,kDACN,eAAAZ,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,sDACN,eAAAZ,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,iOACV;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJZ,OAAA;MAAIG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACqB,MAAO;MAAAhB,QAAA,EAAC;IAAW;MAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC/CZ,OAAA;MAAGG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACsB,IAAK;MAAAjB,QAAA,EAAC;IAA0X;MAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC1ZZ,OAAA;MAAIG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACuB,YAAa;MAAAlB,QAAA,EAAC;IAAkB;MAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5DZ,OAAA;MAAIG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACqB,MAAO;MAAAhB,QAAA,EAAC;IAAc;MAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAClDZ,OAAA;MAAGG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACsB,IAAK;MAAAjB,QAAA,GAAC,kLAAgL,eAAAF,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,+DAA2D;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACjRZ,OAAA;MAAIG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACqB,MAAO;MAAAhB,QAAA,EAAC;IAAW;MAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC/CZ,OAAA;MAAGG,SAAS,EAAEN,OAAO,CAACsB,IAAK;MAAAjB,QAAA,GAAC,wHAA4G,eAAAF,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,+IAA2I,eAAAZ,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,4FAAwF,eAAAZ,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,qQAAiQ,eAAAZ,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,kFAA8E,eAAAZ,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC,0cAAsc;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OAC5pC,CAAC;AACf,CAAC;AAAAS,EAAA,GAnCKpB,UAAU;AAqChB,eAAeA,UAAU;AAAC,IAAAoB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
